        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an experienced graphic designer, and not just in using the tools (which I am! — including the Adobe Creative Suite), but also in effectively managing the projects I work on. What makes me special as a designer is my ability to not only be creative, but to place a huge emphasis on customer service. From the very beginning of a project, I make a point to listen well, ask the right questions, and gain a big picture of a particular project’s goals, including how it might play a role in other initiatives that are established or upcoming.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to bring these skills to web design, in addition to my experience in print.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to become a web designer, to supplement my skills in print design, and round out my all-around creative skills. For starters, I want a solid understanding of:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to be able to offer my clients a complete package of design know-how &mdash; from print to web.</p>
